1. Persistence of data
Explanation: In the current implementation, data is only held in memory, and is lost when the program ends.
Countermeasure: Add a function to save and load data to/from files or databases.

2. Support for concurrent processing
Explanation: The current implementation is single-threaded and does not support simultaneous access from multiple clients.
Countermeasure: Use thread-safe data structures to enable concurrent access.

3. User authentication and access control
Explanation: Anyone can access the KVS.
Countermeasure: Add user authentication functionality to manage access privileges.

4. Logging errors
Explanation: There is no function to log errors that occur.
Countermeasure: Introduce a logging library to log errors and important events to a log file.

5. Expand testing
Explanation: Current testing is limited to basic functions.
Countermeasure: Add test cases that include abnormal cases and edge cases to improve the reliability of KVS.
